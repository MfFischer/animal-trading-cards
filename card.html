              Golden Retrievers are known for their friendly 						
              disposition and intelligence, but did you know they were originally 
              bred in Scotland during the 19th century for hunting? Their keen 
              retrieving skills were valued by hunters for fetching game birds 
              from both water and land.

              Golden Retrievers are well-mannered, loyal companions that are 
              excellent with children and other dogs. They require lots of exercise 
              and love to play.
